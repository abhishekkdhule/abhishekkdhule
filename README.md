## Hi there 👋  I am Abhishek Dhule 👨‍💻
###  Django Developer 💻 | Problem solver 📝 | Deep Learning Enthusiast 🧠

Hi👋 I am Abhishek Dhule, a final year IT Engineering student 👨‍🎓 at University of Mumbai. I have been learning Django since second year of my engineering. I do have created some projects such as a blog application, covid-19 tracker, get weather application, an ecommerce site using django framework. 

💼 I do have gained experience of being a Django Developer Intern at Jugadu.in for three months where I worked on a B2B ecommerce platform. I addded features such as sort the products by price, release date etc. I also created agent referal pipeline which worked such that if a customer uses a referal id of an agent, agent used to get a cut(around 5%) of the total bill of the customer.

I love to work in the field of machine learning and deep learning as well. I have completed certification course on neural networks and CNN offered by deeplearning.ai. I do have created a web application for detecting pneumonia using chest x-ray.
